This PunBB extension allows your forum to authenticate against an OpenLDAP server.

##Installation instructions

* Drop auth_ldap into your punbb/extensions folder
* Edit auth_ldap/auth_ldap.php and modify the server and basedn variables to your environment
* Open http://yourserver/punbb/admin/extensions.php?section=manage and install the extension
* Log in using an LDAP account

##Notes
* After installing this, LDAP users always get priority (the check is done before the built-in authentication).
This means that a local user with the same name as an LDAP user will have their password overwritten.

##Bugs

* Uninstalling doesn't delete the LDAP users.
* The realname is not set from LDAP (add_user() doesn't support it)
